/**
 * <p>The person summary resource defines a subset of information about a person, optimized for a summary view. The person summary is especially useful
 * for applications when providing quick access to the most useful data about a person, such as when retrieving a pedigree or when providing search
 * results.</p>
 *
 * <p>A person summary should contain at least the following (if available):</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>living status</li>
 *   <li>preferred name</li>
 *   <li>gender</li>
 *   <li>birth</li>
 *   <li>death</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Applications may choose to provide additional information to meet the specific requirements of their products.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the <tt>person</tt> element is used as the data format for the person summary resource, but the person summary resource is distinct from
 * the person resource.</p>
